    <p>Data collected by the app remains stored locally, “Comic Vine” provides the new comic book data only when necessary.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The app only collects the data you explicitly enter: the comic book details, and the state of your library.</li>
      <li>Comic book data comes from <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com">Comic Vine</a>. The Comic Vine server can see what you’re searching for, and what specific comic book data is being updated. Your personal library state (what’s been marked as read, what’s archived, etc), is never uploaded to any server.</li>
      <li>Your local data is deleted when you delete the app from your device.</li>
    </ul>
